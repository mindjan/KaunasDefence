To start the project:

1. Go to https://nodejs.org/ and click 'Install' to install Node.js (Don't download Node.exe)
2. Open command line in the project root directory
3. Install git if not installed https://git-scm.com/downloads
4. Install bower `npm install -g bower`
5. Install `npm install gulp -g`
6. Run `npm install`
7. Run `bower install`
8. Run `gulp`

Common issues:

1. If you fail to run npm, you probably need to update your PATH variable

2. If you fail to run gulp, then you have to install gulp globally. Just run `npm install gulp -g`
